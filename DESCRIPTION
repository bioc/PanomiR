Description: PanomiR is a package to detect miRNAs that target groups of
    pathways from gene expression data. This package provides functionality 
    for generating pathway activity profiles, determining differentially
    activated pathways between user-specified conditions, determining 
    clusters of pathways via PCxN package, and generating miRNAs targeting
    clusters of pathways. Each function can be used on its own.
